# ArtemisApp
User Interface Application for the Artemis PLL WIN11/10<br>
Visual CPP project for WIN10:
</br>Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.8.6
</br>

Current build is targeted for WIN10 which seems to work for WIN11 (except for the spawn-window-size controls).

For WIN11, the user will have to manually expand the vertical extents of the console window after executing the app.  At least 50 lines is about optimum (one might need to experiment a bit to get a feel for the correct vertical height).  More than 50 lines doesn't buy any advantages.

Features an on-screen help panel with a verbose help tome available on command.

There is no installer, simply place the executable in the same folder as the PLL register files (TICSpro export)</br>
The executable is not "righteous", either "run anyway" or never again</br>
Know your com port (you'll need it at app_startp)</br>
Run-n-gun</br>
</br>
Integrated help describes available commands (many are directly parallel with the Artemis commands).
