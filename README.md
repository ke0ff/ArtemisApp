# ArtemisApp
User Interface Application for the Artemis PLL WIN11/10<br>
Visual CPP project for WIN10:
</br>Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.8.6
</br>

Current build is targeted for WIN10 which seems to work for WIN11.

Features an on-screen help panel with a verbose help tome available on command.

There is no installer, simply place the executable in the same folder as the PLL (TICSpro export) files</br>
Know your com port (you'll need it at app_startp)</br>
Run-n-gun</br>
A "manual" is forthcomming, but the integrated help should be enough to get one started until it is ready.
